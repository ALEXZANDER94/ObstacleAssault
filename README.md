# ObstacleAssault

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

Made in tandem with the good people at GameDev.tv via Udemy.

Very basic gameplay and components, but still fun to play. Many of the components were build alongside the instructor; however, some components, the level design, and end game were made entirely by me.
